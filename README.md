# 8-Queens-Problem-using-Constraint-Satisfaction-Algorithm


The variables in our constraint-satisfaction problem is the column of the queen in question. 

The domains can be the possible rows.

The eight queens problem poses the question of how eight queens can be placed on a chessboard without any queen attacking another queen. (constraint)

This is the 8 queens problem. The constraints are that the no queen should attack each other. For doing this we have first defined the CSP algorithm in which we have defined the variables, Domains and constraints. Using Backtrack search algorithm we are satidfying the constraints. And then we have defined our 8 queen problem and defined variables, domains and the constraints for this problem. Then we are also looking for consistency and all.
